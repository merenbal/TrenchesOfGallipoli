#First of all, hi!

After learning C# at the basic level at the university,
the first complex task we were asked to do was to make a 
game using Windows forms.

Since my knowledge was limited, I made up for my shortcomings 
by examining the projects on YouTube. Since this is my first 
project, I uploaded it as a starting point for myself.
